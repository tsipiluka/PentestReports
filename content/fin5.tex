On the Apache Server of the \ac{DUT} (port 80) it is possible to access directories via path traversal. By adding the path ”/home/...” to the URL it is possible to see directories which seem to be users of the \ac{DUT}.
The directories are empty.

\subsection{Finding Impact}
The Impact of this finding is an severe Information Disclosure. Attackers could try to guess passwords for the found users and eventually gain access to the \ac{DUT}.

\subsection{Finding Details}

The Server should validate the path before accessing it. A possible solution could be to whitelist the allowed paths, which should be accessible. This would prevent accessing directories of the \ac{DUT} which are not intended to be accessed by the user.
