Visiting port 80 of the \ac{DUT} in a web browser with the path ”/home” reveals the exact version of Apache that is running on the \ac{DUT}.  The version of Apache that is running on the \ac{DUT} is \textbf{”Apache/2.4.54 (Debian)”}. This Finding has a low severity, because it should be more important to use a newer version of Apache to prevent exploits of known vulnerabilities.


\subsection{Finding Impact}
This can be used to find known vulnerabilities in the version of Apache that is running on the \ac{DUT}. These vulnerabilities can be found in chapter 4.

How do you judge the individual technical findings (severity, likelihood)?
What is your suggested remediation, if there is one?
How can the customer validate their remediation is effective once implemented?
