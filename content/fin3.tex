On port 80 the \ac{DUT} is running a vulnerable Apache version (\textbf{”Apache 2.4.54”}). This version has multiple vulnerabilities and shouldn't be used in production. \newline
The following vulnerabilities are known from \ac{CVE} but haven't been exploited on the \ac{DUT}.


\subsection{Finding Impact}
\textbf{CVE-2023-25690:} When the mod\_proxy configuration is enabled a HHTP smuggling attack is possible, which could bypass the access controls.
\newline\newline
\textbf{CVE-2023-27522:} This vulnerability allows an attacker to send a origin header which contains special characters to the server. This could be used truncate/split the response forwarded to the client.
\newline\newline
\textbf{CVE-2006-20001:} This vulnerability allows an attacker to send a specific if request to the server, which could be used to crash the process.
\newline\newline
\textbf{CVE-2022-36760:} Due to an incosistent interpretation of HTTP requests of the server it could be possible for attackers to smuggle HTTP requests to the \ac{AJP} server. 
\newline\newline
\textbf{CVE-2022-37436:} A malicious backend has the ability to terminate the response headers prematurely, leading to certain headers being integrated into the response body. Following headers which serve a security function, they will not be comprehended by the client.
