A portscan of the \ac{DUT} revealed that the Webserver on port 80 is not encrypted.

\subsection*{Finding Impact}
All of the traffic between the client and the Webserver is unencrypted. This allows an attacker to intercept the traffic and read the data.

\subsection*{Finding Details}
The following screenshot shows an excerpt of a wireshark capture. This shows that all the traffis is unencrypted using HTTP:

Following is the output of the portscan which shows that the Webserver on port 80 uses http:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ nmap -A 172.16.0.29
    
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https: //nmap.org ) at 2023-03-06 09:30 CET

    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Traffic between clients and the webserver should be encrypted. This can be done by using a certificate for the webserver. This certificate should be signed by a trusted \ac{CA}. This can be done by using a certificate from a \ac{CA} like \href{https://letsencrypt.org/}{Let's Encrypt}.
