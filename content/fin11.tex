A portscan of the \ac{DUT} revealed that the Webserver on port 80 is not encrypted.

\subsection{Finding Impact}
All of the traffic between the client and the Webserver is unencrypted. This allows an attacker to intercept the traffic and read the data.

\subsection{Finding Details}
The following screenshot shows an excerpt of a wireshark capture. This is how an atacker could intercept the traffic:

Traffic between clients and the webserver should be encrypted. This can be done by using a certificate for the webserver. This certificate should be signed by a trusted \ac{CA}. This can be done by using a certificate from a \ac{CA} like \href{https://letsencrypt.org/}{Let's Encrypt}.
