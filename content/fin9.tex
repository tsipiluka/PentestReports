The Webserver running on port 443 of the \ac{DUT} has ssl2, ssl3 and tls1 enabled. This allows accessing the Webserver with outaded protocols which are vulnerable to attacks.

\subsection{Finding Impact}
Using lower versions than TLS 1.2, can pose security risks to the webserver and your users' data. This is because these older versions have known vulnerabilities and weaknesses that can be exploited by attackers.

\subsection{Finding Details}
This is the proof for the possible usage of SSlv2 to connect to the Webserver:

Disable the usage of ssl2, ssl3 and tls1. This should prevent the usage of outdated protocols which are vulnerable to attacks.
