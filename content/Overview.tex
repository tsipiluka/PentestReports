\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Scope}
This Penetration Test Report is based on the E-Mail from our client Pr. Dr. Bauer. The E-Mail was send on 2023-02-20 13:56 with the subject ”Schriftliche Beschreibung der Laborarbeit 'Offensive Security'” (SHA-224 sum: \newline  dafaf185c6d7ec66804121fd25b8f1165f96aea3e183efbb660d250d). The given scenario is a black box test.
The given \ac{DUT} is a Raspberry Pi.
The \ac{DUT} might be interacting with external systems. Those systems are not included in the scope of this test.
The \ac{DUT} is running on a ”Cortex-A53” CPU which is based on an aarch64 ARM architecture (whole CPU information can be found in the appendix). The running OS is Debian with a 5.15.61-v8+ kernel (whole kernel information can be found in the appendix).

\section{Severities}
Each finding in this report is assigned a severity level. The following table defines the severity levels used in this report. Some findings may be estimated different in the organizational context.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \label{tab:severity}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|p{10cm}|}
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Severity Level}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Definition}} \\ \hline
    \textcolor{green!50!blue}{\textbf{Low}} & Vulnerability that has a limited impact on the system or data and may not require immediate attention. It represents a low risk to the organization and can be addressed in a routine patching cycle or by implementing a simple configuration change.\\ \hline
    \textcolor{orange}{\textbf{Medium}} & Vulnerability that has a moderate impact on the system or data and requires some effort to exploit. It represents a moderate risk to the organization and may require a more thorough analysis and remediation effort. \\ \hline
    \textcolor{red}{\textbf{High}} & Vulnerability that has a significant impact on the system or data and can be easily exploited. It represents a high risk to the organization and requires immediate attention and remediation. \\ \hline

\section{Classification}
Each finding in this report is assigned to a classification. The following table defines the classification levels used in this report. Notice that some findings could be assigned to multiple classifications. For a better overview in this report every finding is assigned only to one classification.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \label{tab:classification}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|p{10cm}|}
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Classification}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Definition}} \\ \hline
    \textbf{Information Disclosure} & Information disclosure vulnerabilities are those that allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from the system.\\ \hline
    \textbf{Denial of Service} & Denial of service vulnerabilities are those that allow an attacker to prevent the system from providing its services.\\ \hline
    \textbf{Elevation of Privilege} & Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities are those that allow an attacker to gain access to resources that are normally protected from the user.\\ \hline
    \textbf{Misonfiguration} & Vulnerabilities that are caused by configurations and can lead to an exploit. \\ \hline
