\chapter{Introduction CHECKS NOCH ENTFERNEN}

\section{Scope}
This Penetration Test Report is based on the E-Mail from our client Pr. Dr. Bauer. The E-Mail was send on 2023-02-20 13:56 with the subject ”Schriftliche Beschreibung der Laborarbeit 'Offensive Security'” (SHA-224 sum: \newline  dafaf185c6d7ec66804121fd25b8f1165f96aea3e183efbb660d250d). The given scenario is a black box test.
The given \ac{DUT} is a Raspberry Pi.
The \ac{DUT} might be interacting with external systems. Those systems are not included in the scope of this test.
The \ac{DUT} is running on a ”Cortex-A53” CPU which is based on an aarch64 ARM architecture (whole CPU information can be found in the appendix). The running OS is Debian with a 5.15.61-v8+ kernel (whole kernel information can be found in the appendix).




\section{Severities}
For each vulnerability you uncover in your testing, you typically provide:
The likelihood of exploitation, taking into account how easy it is to discover and exploit
The impact on the control you get once exploited
Suggested remediation
Suggested validation of remediation effectiveness

Low
Moderate
High
Severe
Critical

    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Severity Level}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Definition}} \\ \hline
    \textcolor{green!50!blue}{\textbf{Low}} & Vulnerability that has a limited impact on the system or data and may not require immediate attention. It represents a low risk to the organization and can be addressed in a routine patching cycle or by implementing a simple configuration change.\\ \hline
    \textcolor{orange}{\textbf{Medium}} & Vulnerability that has a moderate impact on the system or data and requires some effort to exploit. It represents a moderate risk to the organization and may require a more thorough analysis and remediation effort. \\ \hline
    \textcolor{red}{\textbf{High}} & Vulnerability that has a significant impact on the system or data and can be easily exploited. It represents a high risk to the organization and requires immediate attention and remediation. \\ \hline
