As seen in Finding 6 the password of the user ”bluey” can be brute-forced. Even though the weak password is a finding on its own, there should be also a protection against brute-force attacks. This could have stopped the attack in Finding 6. 

\subsection*{Evaluation of Results}

To protect against brute-force attacks the following configuration should be updated/added to the sshd\_config file:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
MaxTries 3
\end{lstlisting}
Also a multi factor authentication could be used for the ssh service.
