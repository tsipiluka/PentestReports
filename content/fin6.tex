Using the Tool ”Hydra” the Password for the User ”bluey” was found in a very short amount of time with Brute Force. The Password is ”phoenix”. As a passwordlist the file ”rockyou.txt” was used which contains about 14 million common passwords. This file can be found online and is accessible for everyone.

\subsection{Finding Impact}
With the password it is possible to login to the \ac{DUT} as the User ”bluey” via ssh. This allows attackers to gain access to the \ac{DUT} and to execute commands as the User ”bluey”. This could lead for example to a 
\ac{RCE} or to a privlige escaltion (horizontal or vertical).

\subsection{Finding Details}
The Password was found using the Tool ”Hydra” with the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ hydra -l bluey -P rockyou.txt 172.16.0.29 ssh -t 4 -V -I
\end{lstlisting}

After the password was found it was possible to login to the \ac{DUT} as the User ”bluey” via ssh:

The password should be changed immediately. Notice that passwordlength is the most important aspect. Don't use common passwords.
