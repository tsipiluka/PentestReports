The SD-Card of the \ac{DUT} is not encrypted.
\subsection*{Finding Impact}
This can be exploited to gain complete access to the \ac{DUT}. Amongst other severe consequences, this could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data. An attacker could manually add himself to the known\_keys file and gain remote access to the \ac{DUT}.

\subsection*{Evaluation of Results}

The whole SD-Card should be encrypted. This could be done by using the \ac{LUKS} encryption.
